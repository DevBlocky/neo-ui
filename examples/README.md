# Neopolitan UI Examples

Here is where you can find hands-on examples of how to use the `neo-ui` backend UI API. If you best learn by example,
then this is probably the best for you. If you want to see the API Reference, Getting Started, or other guides please
see the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/blockba5her/neo-ui/wiki).

## Warning

These examples are just that, *examples*. Do not use these as actual menus since they contain no value whatsoever.
If you are still not convinced, well I guess I can't stop you. But it's still a horrible idea.

## Examples

-   [burger-builder](/burger-builder) - A basic menu where you can build your own burger and have it print the ingredients into the console.
