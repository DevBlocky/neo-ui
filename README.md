# Neopolitan UI

A simple NUI based functional UI for FiveM. Using Lua's fast runtime, NUI & Vue.js, it has optimal performance over
other competitors' native-based menus while being more customizable.

## WIP

This project is a Work-In-Progress. Documentation is very uncomplete, and there are most likely bugs that need to be
weeded out. If you're reading this, use this at your own risk.

## Features

1. **Functional Design** - Many of the other NativeUI use Object-Oriented design, however this is completely functional based
2. **State Management** - An easy lua state manager to create, delete, and modify your menus and buttons
3. **Easy Menu and Button Manipulation** - One simple function to edit your menus and buttons
4. **Eventful Actions** - Events are easy to setup and even easier to use
5. **Templating** - You are able to customize the look of your button text and description using templates
6. **Lists and Checkboxes** - Buttons are easily able to be setup as lists and checkboxes, with the ability to modify them completely.

## Performance Optimized

This UI backend uses NUI & Vue.js instead of native-based drawing to optimize performance while rendering menus.
